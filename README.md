# pmpd
**pmpd** is a collection of objects originally written for [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) by Cyrille Henry.

The library provides real-time simulations of physical behaviors. **pmpd** can be used to create natural dynamic systems, like a bouncing ball, string movement, Brownian movement, chaos, fluid dynamics, sand, gravitation, and more. It can also be used to create displacements thus allowing a completely dynamic approach of pd (max) computing.

With **pmpd** physical dynamics can be modelled without knowing the global equation of the movement. Only the cause of the movement and the involved structure are needed for the simulation. **pmpd** provides the basic objects for this kind of simulation. Assembling them allows the creation of a very large variety of dynamic systems.
